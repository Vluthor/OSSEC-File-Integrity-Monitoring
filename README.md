## **OSSEC: File Integrity Monitoring & Log4Shell Detection**  

This project is a hands-on **intrusion detection** and **vulnerability scanning** lab using **OSSEC HIDS** and **Nessus** to detect **Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) exploits** and **unauthorized file changes**. Securing a system isnâ€™t just about **finding vulnerabilities**
itâ€™s about **detecting and preventing unauthorized changes**.  

In this project:  
- **OSSEC** was used to track **unexpected system modifications**  
- **Nessus** was used to scan for the well-known **Log4Shell vulnerability**  



**Key objectives:**  
âœ” **Set up OSSEC HIDS** for real-time **file integrity monitoring** (FIM)  
âœ” **Scanned for Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)** with Nessus to detect unpatched systems  
âœ” **Tested OSSECâ€™s ability** to detect unauthorized file changes and attacker persistence techniques  
âœ” **Analyzed security logs** and reports to develop remediation strategies

## ðŸ”¹ Tools Used  

- **Nessus Essentials** â†’ Vulnerability scanning & Log4Shell detection  
- **OSSEC HIDS** â†’ Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)  
- **Linux VM** â†’ Controlled test environment for security analysis  
- **Log4j (Vulnerable version)** â†’ Simulated Log4Shell exploitation

## ðŸ”¹ OSSEC Configuration  

ðŸ”¹ OSSEC was configured to **actively monitor system changes** and alert on modifications.  
ðŸ”¹ Reviewed `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` to verify **file integrity monitoring rules** were enabled.  
ðŸ”¹ Ensured that OSSEC **detects and logs new files**, a key step in detecting **backdoors & persistence methods**.

## ðŸ”¹ Detecting Unauthorized File Changes  

One of the most **common post-exploitation techniques** is **dropping malicious files** to maintain access.  
OSSECâ€™s **syscheck** feature is designed to detect **newly added, modified, or deleted files**.  

**What I did:**  
ðŸ”¹ Examined `/var/ossec/rules/ossec_rules.xml` to verify rule configurations.  
ðŸ”¹ Located **Rule #554 (`syscheck_new_entry`)**, which flags **newly added files**.  
ðŸ”¹ OSSEC now detects **any unexpected files placed on the system**, helping to catch **attacker persistence**.

## ðŸ”¹ Nessus Scan: Detecting Log4Shell  

To complement OSSECâ€™s **real-time monitoring**, I ran a **Nessus scan** to check for **Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)** vulnerabilities.  
Nessus was used to **identify vulnerable Log4j instances** and confirm if they were **exploitable**.

**Process:**  
âœ” Configured **Nessus Log4Shell Remote Checks** scan.  
âœ” Verified that **Log4j versions <2.15.0** were flagged as **high risk**.  
âœ” Reviewed Nessus reports for **remediation recommendations**.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways  

âœ” **OSSEC provides real-time file integrity monitoring** to detect unauthorized system changes.  
âœ” **Rule-based detection (syscheck) helps identify attacker persistence techniques** like file modifications.  
âœ” **Nessus effectively scans for Log4Shell and other vulnerabilities** to prevent exploitation.  
âœ” **Combining vulnerability scanning (Nessus) with intrusion detection (OSSEC) improves security posture.**
